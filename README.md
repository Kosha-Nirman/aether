Aether is a minimal Node.js starter template that provides a clean foundation for building scalable applications.

It is designed to keep things lightweight while giving you enough structure to start quickly.

The goal of Aether is to help you focus on your application logic rather than boilerplate setup.

Over time, this template may evolve with best practices and commonly used patterns for Node.js projects.
